# rework in progress ...
I will try to port few llama2.rs to wasm, each will be in a ./portX folder with specific instructions.

A global release including all ports is available in `www`, just run `./run.sh` and go to `http://localhost:8080/`

Maybe host it as a github page ? 

## Check instructions 
1. Port1 [A dirty and minimal port of @Gaxler llama2.rs](https://github.com/mtb0x1/llama2.rs.wasm/blob/main/port1/README.md).
2. Port2 [A dirty and minimal port of @Leo-du llama2.rs](https://github.com/mtb0x1/llama2.rs.wasm/blob/main/port2/README.md).
